FAQ
What is the local cost rate?
Telnyx Voice API calls utilize Telnyx Elastic SIP Trunks. By the nature of SIP Trunking, all calls are local calls, so you'll always be charged the local rate for dialing local prefix numbers, no matter where they are in the world. You can find the most up-to-date local cost rates for every country by selecting it in the drop-down box at the top of this very page.
